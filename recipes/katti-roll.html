    <p>A kati roll is a street-food dish originating from Kolkata, West Bengal, India. In its original form, it is a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in a paratha bread, although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of kati roll.</p>

        <li>Add chicken to a bowl and stir in all the marinade ingredients. Mix well and keep aside for 20 minutes. You can also marinate it for a longer time but 2 hours is generally enough. Make sure to keep it in the refrigerator if marinating for more than 20 mins. </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Add onions, peppers, salt and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add marinated chicken and mix well. Cooked covered for 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat. Take the lid off and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked. Turn the heat off. Add cilantro.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick griddle pan. Remove the Kawan paratha from the plastic wrapping and place it on the griddle. Cook on medium-high heat for about 1 to 1-Â½ minutes on each side or until both sides are golden brown, pressing gently with a spatula.</li>
