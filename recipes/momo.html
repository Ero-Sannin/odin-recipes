    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Momos are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan  and Nepali cuisine that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan and India. Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Dough: The dough is made with all purpose flour, salt and lukewarm water. You can use whole wheat flour but the wrapper will be really dense and chewy. All purpose flour or maida also adds more gluten and makes the wrapper easier to roll and pleat</li>
            <li>Vegetarian Filling: The vegetarian filling for momos is cooked or stir fried before using it. You can use a variety of veggies like onions, cabbage, carrots, capsicum or bell peppers, mushrooms, corn, paneer etc. <br>
                <b>OR</b><br>

All the ingredients - chicken mince, spring onions, onions, celery, ginger, garlic, oyster sauce, pepper, corn flour and salt and mixed together and stuffed in the wrapper. When the momos get steamed, the filling gets cooked - approx 6-7 minutes.
